Hello! Call me **Mila**. I’m a [[neurodiversity]] advocate, consultant, and success coordinator. Welcome to my *digital garden*.
 
This place is a [[environment|sanctuary]] for cultivating my thoughts, interests and ideas [[publicity|in public]]. Currently, I’m learning about disability rights, [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and anything else my mind wonders about.

Please, have a look around.

## Wayfinding

To find your way around, follow a trail of links. Here are some that might help you orient yourself:

- 🌱 [Seeds](/tags/seed): Individual notes in their earliest stages.
- 🪴 ~~**Saplings**:~~ Notes that have grown substantially. *(None yet!)*
- 🌲 ~~**Evergreen**~~: Notes that have been fully developed. *(None yet!)*

Wander through my notes based on their content:

- 🌳 [Stems](tags/stem): Notes that are rooted in a single concept.
- 🪵 [Branches](/tags/branch): Notes that connect two other notes together.
- 🍎 ~~**Fruit**:~~ Fully-developed pieces of writing. *(None yet!)*

…or view a list of all my notes [here](/notes/index).
