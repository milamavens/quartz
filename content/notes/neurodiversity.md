# Origins of the term

**Source:** [Singer, Judy. *NeuroDiversity: The Birth of an Idea.*](https://www.amazon.com/NeuroDiversity-Birth-Idea-Judy-Singer/dp/064815470X)

Traditionally, a woman named Judy Singer is credited with coining the term “neurodiversity.” Her conception of the term was meant to describe an emerging [[socialization|social]] movement whose scale and and [[publicity|visibility]] would be on comparable to the [[feminism|women’s rights]] movement. 

> [!note] My thoughts
> Neurodiversity is an inherently [[intersectionality|intersectional]] concept because what is considered socially acceptable varies across cultures.
> 
> Singer’s expectations for neurodiversity’s revolutionary impact immediately situated the concept within the polarizing landscape of [[identity]] politics. This type of environment overlooks the nuances of neurodiversity in favor of simple “us-versus-them” categorizations.

> Are human beings naturally and immutably [[dualism|dualist]]?
