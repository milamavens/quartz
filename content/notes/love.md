# Defining love

**Source:** [Hooks, Bell. *All About Love: New Visions.* 2018.](https://www.amazon.com/All-About-Love-New-Visions/dp/0060959479)

It is the fact that we lack a universally shared definition of love, Hooks argues, that we find it so difficult to give and receive.

Since love is a cultural phenomenon, it is [[learning|learned]].

## Feeling vs. action

We can attempt to understand love from two different perspectives:

1. Love as a *feeling* (to feel love/loved)
2. Love as an *action* (to love)

Hooks defines love as an action.

> [!note] My thoughts
> I agree with Hooks’ definition of love as an action.
> 
> If love is defined as a feeling (i.e. a physical reaction to [[emotion]]), its existence is purely [[causality|consequent]]; it relies on a prior event to be felt. As an action, love is both antecedent (to love) and consequent (to be loved).
