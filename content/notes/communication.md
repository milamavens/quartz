**Source:** SPK 208-07

- Communication always involves a *sender* and a *recipient*.
- The sender’s *message* is communicated to the recipient through a *medium*.
- Successful communication occurs when the sender’s intended message matches the message received by the recipient.
- *Interference* is anything that disrupts the transmission of the sender’s message to the recipient.
