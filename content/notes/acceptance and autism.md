# Accepting our own autism

## The importance of a formal diagnosis

Accepting that you’re autistic is much easier with a formal diagnosis:

- **An explanation for difficulties.** A formal diagnosis can help explain and validate a person and the things they find difficult, especially for those diagnosed later in life.
- **Inclusion within a population.** A person who knows they’re autistic is more likely to seek inclusion within communities of other autistic people, with whom they may bond over similar experiences.
- **Access to supports.**

> Is a person formally diagnosed? Or is a formal diagnosis given to a person?

> I would say that a formal diagnosis is given to a person. For one thing, a formal diagnosis is difficult to obtain without the proper funds or quality of assessment. If it wasn’t something that was given, I feel that it would deny the inaccessibility of obtaining one. On the other hand, a diagnosis, like language about a person, is a description of them as they experience themselves and as others experience them—it is *not* a description of reality. Saying that a person is “formally diagnosed” seems too absolute; saying a person “has received a formal diagnosis” feels more open-ended.

# Autism awareness vs. acceptance

Advocating for “autism awareness” merely [[publicity|draws attention to]] autism *itself* while overlooking the systemic [[oppression]] and [[socialization|social]] outcasting faced by autistic *people*. 

We prefer advocating for “autism acceptance.” The slight adjustment in [[language]] acknowledges our existence, the challenges we face, and our humanity while also pushing for the formation of a society that accommodates us.

## Negative connotations of “awareness”

## Negative portrayals by leading autism “authorities”

The veil of stigma surrounding autism has persisted because the perceived experts on the subject *(See: Kanner, Autism Speaks)* have depicted autism with historically negative assumptions. The public’s interpretation of autism is aligned with these assumptions, meaning that most “awareness” brought to autistic people is tinted with a *negative* perception. As such, the stigma persists when public information is entrenched in these assumptions, which are more widely recognizable to a broader audience.
