[[autism|Autism]], [[neurodiversity|Neurodiversity]]

The neurodiversity movement recognizes autism as a form of neurodivergence. 

# The shift towards neurodiversity

A growing majority of autistic people are adopting the neurodiversity framework to understand ourselves and advocate for our needs.

Some examples, from my personal experience:

- Puzzle piece → Infinity symbol
- Person-first language → Identity-first language
- Deficits-based understanding → Strengths-based understanding
- Autism as a disability → Being disabled by oppressive systems
- Deficits-based treatment → Self-advocacy training

# Autism as the representative of neurodiversity

Most of the [[public|visible]] representation of neurodiversity is made autistic and auDHD (autistic and ADHD) people. More specifically, the main representatives are white, low-supports needs autistics. 

As a self-advocate who fits into that demographic, it’s imperative that I acknowledge the boundary between the nature my needs versus the needs of those who require more supports.

> How are higher-support needs autistics advocating for themselves? What do they advocate for? 
> I want to better understand the nuances of self-advocacy across the entire spectrum.
