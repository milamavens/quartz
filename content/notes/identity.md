The **identity** of someone or something is a live representation of the characteristics or narratives that “fit” best. 

# Scale of identity formation

**Source:** WOS 225

A person’s identity can be conceptualized in relation to the scale of its presence:

1. **Micro-level:** Here, identity is formed within a singular individual. 

A person can freely try on different identities (see: [[cognitive liberty]]) to see if they fit and express their identity through [[language]], [[labels]], clothing, activities, association, etc.

2. **Meso-level:** Here, identity is formed in relation to other people in the immediate community. 

[[acceptance|Acceptance]] or rejection from others further refine the process.

3. **Macro-level:** Here, identity is formed within the larger context of society.

Experiences of [[oppression]] affect identity here. [[privacy|Private]] identity is made a [[publicity|public]] matter.
