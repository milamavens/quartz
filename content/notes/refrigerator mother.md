The concept of the **refrigerator mother** was popularized by Bruno Bettelheim in his book, *The Empty Fortress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of Self*. It’s an outdated and sexist idea that points to the “coldness” of mothers towards their [[autism|autistic]] children as being the cause of their behavior.
