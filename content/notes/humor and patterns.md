# Humor and breaking patterns

> “John Cleese describes humor and laughing as ‘the train is moving along a track and the comedy comes when the train derails.’ Lots of comedy works by establishing a pattern and then breaking the pattern. That’s why a lot of traditional jokes involve 3 characters. ‘A priest, a rabbi, and a minister walk into a bar.’ The first two do very normal things and that is the smallest amount of repetitions that can establish the pattern. The 3rd does something unexpected and the pattern is broken and the result is a reaction from the listeners. A person who does something completely out of the ordinary is always going to elicit some laughter. It’s not always a mean reaction. But it’s a way of expressing the tension and release.”

## Breaking patterns to be humorous

Comedians use humor by surprising their audience and diverging from their expectations.

## Laughter as a release of tension

Laughter is a natural reaction to unexpected events. Laughing can help lighten a tense moment and protect a person from discomfort.
