# Why is love hard?

## Love and patriarchy

Hooks believes our culture is making a departure from love to cynicism and lovelessness. Part of this has to do with [[patriarchy]]:

- Men are the foremost authorities on [[love]].
	- The [[publicity]] of men’s activity overshadow those of women.
	- Women’s expression of strong emotions are more illogical than men’s discussion of them. (Love is a very strong emotion.)
- Love is assumed to be learned from [[family]]. If the family fails (either in general or to teach children love), then it’s the mother’s fault.

## Love and age

Part of this also has to do with young people’s growing cynicism towards love.
