# Why is love hard?

## Defining love

Hooks says that loving and being loved is so hard for us because we lack a clear definition of love. 

What love *is*:

- **Made up of several dimensions**, such as affection, nurturing, care, compassion, etc.
- **An action.** Engaging in an action requires making a choice and assuming responsibility for its consequences.

What love is *not*:

- **Any form of harm**, abuse, or neglect.

If a clear definition of love would help us learn to love better, why are we so hesitant to come up with one? Hooks thinks that, by defining what love is and is not, people would be fearful of having to admit that their living environments are unloving. It’s easier for people to believe that love means something different for each person, rather than to confront areas of lovelessness.

## Why does love go missing?

### Love and justice

Love and justice go together because, without justice, love wouldn’t be present.

Children learn love through the actions of their family members. However, as opposed to our wider culture, a family is private and governed by the authority of parents alone.

Parents who discipline their children with harm, abuse, or neglect are not loving and do not teach their children love. Their harmful actions aren’t brought to justice, either, because children have no civic rights to challenge the authority of their parents.

### Love and lying

Patriarchy also contributes to how people learn to lie.

Patriarchy encourages men to lie to *gain power*.

- Boys are taught not to cry and to “man up.” They learn to conceal their emotions to not be perceived as weak.
- Men with power can do or get whatever they want.

Patriarchy encourages women to lie to *gain social favorability.*

- ...

Effects of lying on love

- Decreased trust. Genuine love *must* include trust.
- Abuse. Lying can be a tool used for abuse, especially psychological abuse.



### Love and patriarchy

Hooks believes our culture is making a departure from love to cynicism and lovelessness. Part of this has to do with [[patriarchy]]:

- Men are the foremost authorities on [[love]].
	- The [[publicity]] of men’s activity overshadow those of women.
	- Women’s expression of strong emotions are more illogical than men’s discussion of them. (Love is a very strong emotion.)
- Love is assumed to be learned from [[family]]. If the family fails (either in general or to teach children love), then it’s the mother’s fault.

## Love and age

Part of this also has to do with young people’s growing cynicism towards love.
