A book written by Temple Grandin. Published in 2013.

> [!info] About the author
> **Mary Temple Grandin** (1947-) is an animal behaviorist who was diagnosed as [[autism|autistic]] in her adulthood. She advocates for the humane treatment of livestock and for the autistic community.

# How autism has been understood in the past

## Through autism “experts”

The earliest “expert” on autism was a man named *Leo Kanner*. Kanner’s earliest work focused on children who showed symptoms of “childhood schizophrenia,” yet also showed peculiar interests and an insistence on sameness. Kanner attributed the cause of autistic behavior to psychological forces inflicted in childhood, which only became more widespread upon the popularization of the [[refrigerator mother]] concept. 

*(See: [[autism and acceptance]])*

Around the same time as Kanner conducted his research, a German scientist named *Hans Asperger* was researching children with “savant” talents. A new understanding of autism emerged when news of *Asperger’s syndrome*, which was regarded as a “milder” form of autism, arrived in America.

## Through the *DSM*

The inclusion of autism in the third edition of the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* signaled the emergence of a surge in autism diagnoses. Following the fourth edition, the diagnostic criteria expanded even more broadly, so more people received diagnoses.

As the development of autism criteria was in its initial stages, some internal shifts within clinical psychology and psychiatry chipped away at the reliability of the *DSM*’s diagnostic criteria in general. 

## Through neuroscience

Breakthroughs in the field of neuroscience shed new light on how autism was understood. Researchers found a few notable yet generalized similarities between the brains of autistic people:

- Reduced cortical activation to faces.
- Enlarged amygdalae.
- Enlarged head / brain size.
- Areas of over- and under-connectivity compared to non-autistic brains.

## Through genetics

Breakthroughs in the field of genetics caused a craze about finding the potential “causes” of autism. However, as researchers soon found out, autism is *heterogeneous*, meaning its presence isn’t caused by any one singular gene. Research in this area pressed on, despite the complexity of the situation.

## Through the environment

While geneticists bore into the specifics of mutations and the gene sequences, other organizations turned their attention towards environmental factors like automobile exhaust, pesticides, and vaccines. Not many objective results—not to mention, ethical ones—came from this approach, like the harmful and incorrect conclusion that vaccines cause autism.

## Through sensory sensitivities

Although sensory sensitivities and [[overstimulation]] have a profound impact on the experiences of autistic people, there was a time when the topic of sensory issues was seldom discussed in research. Now, we have new knowledge and autistic self-advocacy to support the connection of autism to sensory sensitivities. It’s possible to understand the observable [[behavior]] of autistic people as a function of coping with sensory overload and stress.

This type of understanding leans on the [[self-advocacy]] of autistic people for support in research. However, creating a representative sample size becomes an issue if the only autistic people self-advocating are the ones who are able to do so verbally. Reports from nonverbal and higher support needs autistics *must* be included and taken seriously in order for a sample of this population to be truly representative.

> “But wait. Isn’t the diagnosis of autism based on behaviors? Isn’t our whole approach to autism a result of what the experience looks like from the outside (the acting self) rather than what the experience feels like from the inside (the thinking self)?
> 
> Yes. Which is why I believe the time has come to rethink the autistic brain.”

# How we can rethink our understanding of autism

## Through labels

Autism has been known by many different names—“autistic disorder,” “Asperger’s,” “childhood schizophrenia,” “PDD-NOS,” and more. The tendency of researchers to [[labels|label]] everything deemed “abnormal” creates the illusion of rigid, “label-locked” distinctions between conditions. People are left wondering, “what *am* I?” rather than, “how can I be *supported*?”

Instead, Grandin proposes that we support autistic people based on their symptoms (bottom-up) rather than an overgeneralized set of diagnostic criteria (top-down).

## Through strengths

Traditionally, researchers have approached autism with a deficits-based mindset. Only in the early 2000’s did researchers begin to reframe their assumptions to look for the possible strengths of autistic people, such as:

- Increased attention to detail
- Strengthened long-term memory
- Enhanced [[creativity]]

Keep in mind that these “strengths” shouldn’t be overgeneralized to apply to all autistic people, nor do they include the skills of autistic savants.

To draw out these strengths, Grandin discourages the cramming of autistic people into a set of standardized procedures (ex. school curricula, workplace policies, etc.) and advocates for providing *supported exploration* of areas of proficiency.

> “I know that trying to imagine where we’ll be sixty years from now is a fool’s errand. But I have confidence that whatever the thinking about autism is, it will incorporate a need to consider it brain by brain, DNA strand by DNA strand, trait by trait, strength by strength, and, maybe most important of all, individual by individual.”
