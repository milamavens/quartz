# Neurotypical patterns of behavior

## Sensory perception

- **Desensitization:** Gradual dulling of sensory stimuli due to repeated exposure and symbolic association.
- **Symbolic filtering:** Perceiving a sensory stimulus as a singular word or concept.
- **Multi-focus:** Perceiving multiple sensory stimuli at once.
- **Sensory integration:** Combining and balancing of functions related to sensory perception into a unified whole. Helps with preventing sensory overload.

## Beliefs and learning

- **Thinking in symbols:** Representing concepts not with words, but with the symbols they signify and all their associations.
- **Symbolic beliefs:** Accepting something as true because its symbolic meaning is generally accepted by their entire culture.
- **Perception limited by beliefs:** Failing to update existing beliefs due to symbolic filtering. *(See previous section)*
- **Strong social reality:** Constructing an understanding of reality from social evidence rather than from observation.
