# Defining surprise

*Surprise* is a natural reaction to events that deviate from our expectations and our understanding of the world. *(See: [[patterns|Patterns]])* It’s difficult to define what surprise actually *is*—it could be an emotion, a cognitive state, or something else.

## How we experience surprise

Luna breaks down surprise into a rapid-fire four-step sequence:

1. **Freeze:** Something surprising hijacks our attention. We stop what we are doing and become acutely aware of the present moment and our surroundings.

2. **Find:** We scan the [environment] for clues about how we should react and for explanations as to why the surprising event occurred.

3. **Shift:** The surprising event triggers an expansion of our perceptions and understanding of the world.

4. **Share:** Processing surprising events puts a cognitive burden on our minds. We relieve this burden by sharing what happened with others.

# How much surprise is too much?

- Too *much* surprise → anxiety
- Too *little* surprise → boredom
